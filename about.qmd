Most of my career has been in immunology and oncology, and my primary research interest centers on refining CAR-T constructs and gene editing enhancements, driving their optimal expression, functionality, and anti-tumor ability within in vitro and in vivo models. Some techniques that are a part of my work are flow cytometry, in vivo cancer mouse models, and playing around with whatever data analysis tools I can figure out.
